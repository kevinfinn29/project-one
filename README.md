My first project with Code Institute. 

# 7 Summit Expeditions

  7 Summit Expeditions is where people looking to complete the 7 Summits will go to find the best and most experienced mountain guides. The 7 Summits is a grand slam for mountaineers, and completion of this can be a life goal for many.
  
# User Experience (UX)
  
# User Stories
  - First Time Visitor Goals

      - As a first time visitor, I am drawn to the opportuntity to climb some of the largest mountains in the world.
   
      - As a first time visitor, I want to see the expeditions available and the difference between the opportunties.
    
      - As a first time visitor, I want to be able to make an enquiry to understand more about these opportunties and the potential to get involved.
    
    
  - Returning Visitor Goals

      - As a returning visitor, I want to be able to see pricing and logistical information that I may be able to compare with competitors.
    
      - As a returning visitor, I want to be able to find updated information regarding expedition dates that may change depending on seasonal factors and availability.

# - Design
  - Colour Scheme
      - The main colors used will be Midnight Grey, Burnt Orange and White. The grey and white is used to emphasise the remote and grey tendencies of a mountainous region and the orange element will be used to provide contrast to these elements.
      
  - Typography
      - The Ubunto Mono font is used throughout the website with Open Sans set as the fallback font in case the font is not imported correctly. Ubunto Mono is a very defined and aesthetically pleasing font which will fit in well with the colour scheme present.

  -Imagery
      - The Hero image on the home page is important as it represents what the goal of the website and user experience is all about. It catches the user's attention and immediately provides them with some sense of scale as to the challenges and expeditions being offered on the website.

# - Introduction

   - You are introduced to to mountainous backdrop phot with an intoductory message.

# - 7 Summits

   - You are then presented with a view of the 7 different summits available to climb. The following page provides dates and availability.

# - Issues

   - I was unable to add a page where i wanted to include a form so instead resorted to including a small area where an email address could be input and details would then be sent to the user.
   - I was unable to complete the project as I wanted due to time contraints. There is very little in regards to responsive design as a result.
